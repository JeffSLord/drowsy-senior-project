# Classification

## Potential Techniques

### Support Vector Machine (SVM)
A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a discriminative classifier formally defined by a separating hyperplane. In other words, given labeled training data (supervised learning), the algorithm outputs an optimal hyperplane which categorizes new examples.

### Neural Network
Use a Deep Neural Network (DNN) to learn the different classes.
