# Neural Network
## Tensorflow
The current implementation for our neural network test is a deep neural network implemented with tensorflow's DNNClassifier. The results are promisng in a simple 2-Dimensional test with 99.95% accuracy with a simple example problem.

### Parameters
The adjustable parameters for the DNN include the optimizer and activation function.
