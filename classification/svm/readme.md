The SVM had to be built from scratch to understand the steps. The already existing SVM's serve as a good reference, but it was not as simple as we had hoped to modify them to fit our needs. So our own was built.

The current version being used is **jeff_linear_svm**

The SVM takes data that is stored in the CSV format, organized as follows:

| Classifier (True/False) | Feature 1 | Feature 2 | ... | Feature N |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 0  | float  | float  | ...  | float  |
| 1  | float  | float  | ...  | float  |
| 1  | float  | float  | ...  | float  |
| 0  | float  | float  | ...  | float  |
| ...  | ...  | ...  | ...  | ...  |

## In a 2-Dimensional space, the SVM produces the following:
